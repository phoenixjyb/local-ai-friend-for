# Samsung S24 Ultra - Language-Not-Supported Fix

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issue Identified**

Your debug logs show the ASR is failing with `language-not-supported` error because:

- **Your System Language:** `zh-CN` (Chinese)
- **ASR Hardcoded Language:** `en-US` (English) 
- **Problem:** Samsung WebView doesn't support English ASR on Chinese-configured system

## ðŸ”§ **Quick Fix Options**

### Option 1: Change Browser Language (Immediate Fix)
1. **Open Chrome/Edge Settings**
2. **Go to Language Settings**
3. **Add English (United States) as primary language**
4. **Restart browser and test again**

### Option 2: Test with System Language
The ASR should work with Chinese language. Try saying something in **Chinese** instead of English.

### Option 3: Code Fix (Development)
If this is for development, the code needs to detect and use the system language:

```javascript
// Instead of hardcoded 'en-US'
const language = navigator.language || 'en-US'  // Uses zh-CN automatically
```

## ðŸ“± **Expected Behavior After Fix**

With your `zh-CN` language setting, you should:
1. **Speak in Chinese** for best results
2. Or **change browser language** to English first
3. **Wave visualization should stay visible** for 3+ seconds
4. **Get successful transcription** in the correct language

## ðŸ§ª **Test Again**

After applying one of the fixes above:
1. Open the Debug Panel
2. Click "Test Voice Recognition" 
3. **Speak in Chinese** (if keeping zh-CN) or **English** (if changed to en-US)
4. Wave should appear and stay visible
5. Should get transcription without "language-not-supported" error

The visualization disappearing quickly was caused by the immediate language error, not the visualization code itself.

## ðŸ’¡ **Technical Details**

Your browser reports:
- **Language:** `zh-CN` 
- **User Agent:** Chrome 138.0.0.0 on macOS
- **Expected ASR Language:** Should match `zh-CN` for best compatibility

The Samsung WebView speech recognition is working correctly - it just needs the right language configuration!

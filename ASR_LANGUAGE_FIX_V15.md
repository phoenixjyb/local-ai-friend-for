# ASR Language Detection Fix - Version 15

## 🎯 **Core Issue Identified from Logs**

Your logs revealed the exact problem:
```
🎤 ASR language check failed {"error":{}}
🎤 ASR availability checked {"available":{"available":false}}
```

The `SpeechRecognition.getSupportedLanguages()` call was failing with an empty error, causing the entire ASR detection to report as unavailable.

## ✅ **Critical Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Non-Blocking Language Detection**
- **Problem**: Failed language check was blocking entire ASR availability
- **Solution**: Made language check non-blocking with Samsung S24 fallback
- **Fallback Languages**: `['en-US', 'en-GB', 'ko-KR']` (common Samsung supported)

### 2. **Enhanced Web ASR Error Handling**
- **Added specific error types**:
  - `not-allowed` → Microphone permission denied
  - `service-not-allowed` → Samsung Voice service disabled  
  - `no-speech` → No speech detected
  - `network` → Samsung Voice service connection issue
- **Detailed error logging** with event type and message

### 3. **Robust Direct Web ASR Test**
- Enhanced the "Test Web ASR" button with:
  - Detailed event logging
  - Samsung-specific error messages
  - Better timeout handling
  - Result confidence tracking

## 🔬 **What This Fixes**

Based on your logs showing:
- ✅ **Ollama Connected**: `http://127.0.0.1:11434` ✅
- ✅ **Permissions Granted**: `speechRecognition: granted` ✅  
- ✅ **TTS Working**: `18 voices available` ✅
- ❌ **ASR Languages**: `0` (was blocking availability)

Now:
- ASR should show as **Available: ✅** (language check won't block)
- Voice recognition should work via web ASR fallback
- Better error messages for Samsung-specific issues

## 📱 **Testing Instructions**

1. **Install**: `ai-companion-s24-asr-enhanced-debug-v15.apk`
2. **Test ASR Capabilities**: Should now pass with fallback languages
3. **Test Voice Recognition**: Try the hybrid approach
4. **Test Direct Web ASR**: Use the enhanced direct test button
5. **Check Logs**: Look for detailed error messages if it still fails

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

- **ASR Available**: Should now show ✅ (was ❌)
- **ASR Languages**: Should show `3` (fallback: en-US, en-GB, ko-KR)
- **Voice Recognition**: Should work via web ASR
- **Detailed Errors**: If it fails, you'll get specific Samsung guidance

---

**Key Fix**: The app no longer fails completely when Samsung's language detection API returns an empty error. It gracefully falls back to common Samsung-supported languages and continues with web ASR testing.
